# My Data Science Labs

This repository is a collection of data science experiments and explorations, applying machine learning, deep learning, and other analytical methods to solve fundamental problems and practical use cases.

Beyond standard knowledge and common applications, the goal is to explore how different domains shape their own use cases, such as in Product & Marketing; Finance; Healthcare and Medical or other fields. This repo serves as a hands-on lab for testing ideas, learning new techniques, and bridging theory with real-world applications across domains.
